# A-Machine-Learning-Approcah-to-Analyze-the-statistics-of-Football-Players
In this project I tried to predict which players should be sold and which ones should be retained by the team at the end of every season based on their performance and other factors with SVM and KNN classifiers with approx 80% accuracy 
# Dataset
The dataset was not found anywhere. So data has been extracted from the various sports websites by webscraping method. Here for webscraping an Open Scource software Parsehub have been used
# Progress
For now the data that has been extracted contain the statistics of all the five years from 2014-15 season to 2019-20 season. But for now the preprocess and classification has been done based on the data for the 2018-19 season only. So the final dataset contains the total preprocessed dataset for the season 2018-19 season and the code can be found in the "2018-19" directory.
# Training 
For training purpose the SVM and KNN classifiers of sklearn library of python has been used.
# Future Target
To increase the size of the full dataset by preprocessing the extracted data for all the seasons and increase the accuracy.
# Publication
The paper has been published to IJSREM journal in the december 2019 edition.
